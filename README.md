# Obsidian local images

**This plugin is in early development, backups are a good idea ;)**

Finds hotlinked images in your notes, downloads and saves them locally and finally adjusts the link in your note to point to the local file.

## Development

```
# Start the bundler in watch mode
npm run dev

# It's useful to set a symlink so you don't have to copy files over constantly
ln -s /home/user/code/obsidian-local-images /home/user/notes/dev/.obsidian/plugins/local-images
```
